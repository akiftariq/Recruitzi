Node:
	Purpose of Node.
	Installation of Node.
	Execute javascript code/files with Node. (using node command)

NPM:
	Purpose of npm.
	Executing basic commands of npm to install packages like npm install
	Difference between npm install --save and npm install --save-dev

HTTP:
	We are using HTTP protocol for our communication between browser and backend api.
	HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE etc.)
	HTTP Status Codes (200, 401, 404 etc.)
	HTTP Request and Response and their headers.

ExpressJS:
	Purpose of Express JS
	Routing in Express JS (https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html)
	Processing of HTTP Requests in ExpressJS (req parameter)
	Sending HTTP Response (res parameter)
	Reading headers of HTTP Requests (We read authenticate header in authenticate menthod of auth.js (line#: 7))
	Express middlewares: We used the concepts of middlewares to add the check of authentication in most of the routes like in (app.get('/api/user', auth.authenticate, userRepository.getUsers);) (https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html)

Rest API and Microservices:
	Purpose of RESTful APIs.
	Restful APIs help us build applications using Microservice Architecture. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTAcCNbJ7KE)
	What are other protocols for building APIs to build applications (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vLxWqE94l4)

Using thirdparty libraries in Node:
	We used express, pg, bcrypt and jsonwebtoken. (Each of these libraries had a specific functionality that we need to use in our code).
	Installation of packages or thirdparty libraries in our project using npm which we need to use in our code.
	using import statement to use the thirdparty in our code.
